How can you help?","answer":"Public Teams can have unlimited members and we recommend it for open source projects and knowledge sharing.<br><br>For larger open-source projects, it's common in their workflow to bake documentation until it's ready to go public.

Fee for members added in-cycle will also be prorated and added to the next bill. <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/c/tutorials/%2F%40docs%2Funlock-team-member-limit#How-much-does-HackMD-cost\">Learn more here</a>."},"question10":{"question":"What will happen if I stop paying and the Prime subscription expires?","answer":"For a Team Workspace, when the Prime subscription expires, the workspace and the notes in it will become read-only. You can still remove team members, switch team ownership to another user, or delete you team altogether.<br><br>The workspace will become fully functional again once you reduce the number of team members down to 3 or less, or resume Prime Team subscription.<br><br>For a personal Workspace, advanced features that comes with Prime plan will be unavailable until you subscribe to it again."},"question11":{"question":"What is the character limit for notes?","answer":"For the free plan, there is a character limit of 100,000 per note.
